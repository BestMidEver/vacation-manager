## Demo

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on a cloud server with email notification. See below for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Cloud Server

You need a server with docker compose installed.

I chose [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/3a4b7d44cada) droplet with docker compose pre-installed, you are free to choose otherwise.
